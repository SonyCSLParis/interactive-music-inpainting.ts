# Interactive Music Inpainting for the Web

This repository holds the source code for the web-based, AI-assisted interactive music creation apps developed by Th√©is Bazin at Sony CSL Paris.
These apps are all based on *inpainting*, that is, the use of AI-models to transform images, sounds or sheets in a *local* fashion: just tell the model which zones of the media you'd like to transform (because you don't it or because you'd like to see a variation of it!) and it will regenerate it for you.

Thanks to the very intuitive and user-friendly interactions offered by inpainting, these apps do not require users to perform cumbersome micro-level edits and work nicely on mobile as well.

Note that these apps each work in tandem with a specific AI models for inference. The respective models are distributed as Docker images, the [relevant links](#running-the-models-locally) run commands are provided in this manual.

**PIANOTO** helps you be the piano maestro that you deserve to be. It is an A.I.-powered interactive MIDI piano roll, for mobile and desktop.
Swipe on the musical representation to regenerate zones, always staying coherent with the context!

**NOTONO** lets you use your visual brain to create instrument sounds. Your guitar sample is lacking some depth? Paint some subs from an organ into it! Generate new sounds from scratch or drag-and-drop sounds of your choice into NOTONO to edit them.

**NONOTO** is an interactive interface for symbolic sheet music generation and transformation by inpainting.
Along with the DeepBach model by Ga√´tan Hadjeres, NONOTO lets you generate 4-part chorale-like music in the style of J.S. Bach. Synchronize the app with Ableton Live via the included Ableton Link support and route the output via MIDI to get a smart, melodic and harmonic 4-channel sequencer. Get creative with the chorales by routing the different voices to custom synthesizers!

These apps can be used either as standard web applications or as a packaged [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app (which brings a few perks such as native drag-out or the support for Ableton-Link).
They all share the same audio engine, based on the Web Audio API through Yotam Mann's [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/).
They all support MIDI In and Out for interoperability with external software or hardware, via Jean-Philippe C√¥t√©'s [webmidi.js](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/) helper library over the Web MIDI API.

## Installation

### Packaged Electron applications (Desktop)

You can download MacOS and Linux standalone applications
[here](https://github.com/SonyCSLParis/NONOTO/releases).

### Manual installation

We recommended using the `nvm` installation manager for Node.js, available
[here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
The music-inpainting.ts apps are currently developed with Node.js version `16.15.0`.

We use the standard `npm` package manager.

The various apps can be installed as follows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SonyCSLParis/music-inpainting-ts.git
cd NONOTO
npm install
```

Once, this is done, the NONOTO dev server (an Electron app with live-reloading) can be started with:

```sh
npm start
```

## Running the models locally

We **strongly** recommend running these images on a machine equipped with an NVIDIA CUDA-compatible GPU.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note the additional `serve` command in the `docker run` command for PIA!

|Application|Model|Docker image|Sample command (with recommended arguments and parameters)|
|-----------|----|-----|-------|
|üéπ PIANOTO|PIA v3|`public.ecr.aws/csl-music-team/piano_inpainting_app:v3`|`docker run -p 5000:<YOUR_LOCAL_PORT> --rm --gpus <GPU_INDEXES> public.ecr.aws/csl-music-team/piano_inpainting_app:v3 serve`|
|üîä NOTONO|NOTONO|`public.ecr.aws/csl-music-team/notono:pytorch-1.11.0-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime`|`docker run -p 5000:<YOUR_LOCAL_PORT> --rm --gpus <GPU_INDEXES> public.ecr.aws/csl-music-team/notono:pytorch-1.11.0-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime`
|üéº NONOTO|DeepBach|`public.ecr.aws/csl-music-team/deepbach:latest`|`docker run -p 5000:<YOUR_LOCAL_PORT> --rm --gpus <GPU_INDEXES> public.ecr.aws/csl-music-team/deepbach:latest --num_iterations_per_quarter=25 --num_iterations_per_quarter_initial_generate=10`


### Example

To run PIANOTO locally with GPU support on GPU index 0 and expose the model on port 6000, run the following command (you might need to run this command as root depending on your installation of Docker):

```shell
docker run -p 5000:6000 --rm --gpus 0 public.ecr.aws/csl-music-team/piano_inpainting_app:v3 serve
```

Leave this running in the background, then launch the `music-inpainting.ts` interface, set the **Self-hosted API address** field to `http://localhost:6000` and choose the **PIANOTO** mode, that's it!
